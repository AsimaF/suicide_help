    <h2>Understanding Suicide</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Suicide prevention starts with recognizing the warning signs and taking them seriously. <br> <br> If you think a friend or family member is suicidal, there's plenty you can do to save a life.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The World Health Organization estimates that approximately 1 million people die each year from suicide. What drives so many individuals to take their own lives? <br> <br> To those who are not in the grips of suicidal depression and despair, it’s difficult to understand what drives so many individuals to take their own lives. <br> <br> But a suicidal person is in so much pain that they can see no other option. Suicide is a desperate attempt to escape suffering that has become unbearable. Blinded by feelings of self-loathing, hopelessness, and isolation, a suicidal person can’t see any way of finding relief except through death. But despite their desire for the pain to stop, most suicidal people are deeply conflicted about ending their own lives. They wish there was an alternative to suicide, but they just can’t see one.</p>

    <h3>Common Misconceptions about Suicide</h3>
    <br>
    <h4>Myth: People who talk about suicide wont really do it. <br> <br> Fact : Almost everyone who attempts suicide has given some clue or warning. Don’t ignore even indirect references to death or suicide. Statements like “You’ll be sorry when I’m gone,” “I can’t see any way out,”—no matter how casually or jokingly said—may indicate serious suicidal feelings.</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Myth: Anyone who tries to kill themselves must be crazy. <br> <br> Fact: Most suicidal people are not psychotic or insane. They are upset, grief-stricken, depressed, or despairing, but extreme distress and emotional pain are not necessarily signs of mental illness.</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Myth: If someone is determined to kill themselves, nothing is going to stop them. <br> <br> Fact: Even a very severely depressed person has mixed feelings about death, fluctuating between wanting to live and wanting to die. Rather than wanting death, they just want the pain to stop—and the impulse to end their life does not last forever.</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Myth: People who die by suicide are people who were unwilling to seek help. <br> <br> Fact: Many people try to get help before attempting suicide. In fact, studies indicate that more than 50 percent of suicide victims had sought medical help in the six months prior to their deaths.</h4>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Myth: Talking about suicide may give someone the idea. <br> <br> Fact: You don’t give someone suicidal ideas by talking about suicide. Rather, the opposite is true. Talking openly and honestly about suicidal thoughts and feelings can help save a life.</h4>

    <h2>Tips</h2>

    <br>
    <h3>1. Speak up if you're worried</h3>
    <br>
    <p>If you spot the warning signs of suicide in someone you care about, you may wonder if it’s a good idea to say anything. What if you’re wrong? What if the person gets angry? In such situations, it’s natural to feel uncomfortable or afraid. But anyone who talks about suicide or shows other warning signs needs immediate help—the sooner the better. <br> Talking to a friend or family member about their suicidal thoughts and feelings can be extremely difficult for anyone. But if you’re unsure whether someone is suicidal, the best way to find out is to ask. You can’t make a person suicidal by showing that you care. In fact, giving a suicidal person the opportunity to express their feelings can provide relief from loneliness and pent-up negative feelings, and may prevent a suicide attempt.
    <br>
    Ways to start a conversation about suicide:
    <br>
    “I have been feeling concerned about you lately.”
     <br>
     “Recently, I’ve noticed some differences in you and wondered how you are doing.”
     <br>
    “I wanted to check in with you because you haven’t seemed yourself lately.”
    <br>
    Questions you can ask:
    <br>
    “When did you begin feeling like this?”
    <br>
     “Did something happen to make you start feeling this way?”
    <br>
    “How can I best support you right now?”
    <br>
    “Have you thought about getting help?”
    <br>
    <br>
    What you can say that helps:
    <br>
    “You are not alone in this. I’m here for you.”
    <br>
    “You may not believe it now, but the way you’re feeling will change.”
    <br>
    “I may not be able to understand exactly how you feel, but I care about you and want to help.”
    <br>
    “When you want to give up, tell yourself you will hold off for just one more day, hour, minute—whatever you can manage.”</p>
    <br>
    <h3>2.Offer help and support</h3>
    <br>
    If a friend or family member is suicidal, the best way to help is by offering an empathetic, listening ear. Let your loved one know that they’re not alone and that you care. Don’t take responsibility, however, for healing your loved one. You can offer support, but you can’t make a suicidal person get better. They have to make a personal commitment to recovery.
    <br>
    It takes a lot of courage to help someone who is suicidal. Witnessing a loved one dealing with thoughts about ending their own life can stir up many difficult emotions. As you’re helping a suicidal person, don’t forget to take care of yourself. Find someone that you trust—a friend, family member, clergyman, or counselor—to talk to about your feelings and get support of your own.

    <h2>Risk Factors</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Depression in particular plays a large role in suicide. The difficulty that suicidal people have imagining a solution to their suffering is due in part to the distorted thinking caused by depression.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Common suicide risk factors include:</h3><br> <p>1. Mental illness, alcoholism or drug abuse<br> 2. Previous suicide attempts, family history of suicide, or history of trauma or abuse<br> 3. Terminal illness or chronic pain, a recent loss or stressful life event<br> 4. Social isolation and loneliness.</p>
