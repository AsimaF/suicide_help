<h1>How can I get emotional support?</h1>
<br>
<p>Remember that however you feel there are people who will listen and who want to help.
<br>
Let family or friends know what you are going through. They may be able to offer support and help keep you safe. They may not be able to make you feel better straight away. But tell them how you feel. They may help you see your situation in a different way or think of other options.
<br>
If you can’t talk to family or friends, you may be able to get emotional support from other places. You could talk to:
<br>
1. someone from an emotional support line,
<br>
2. therapist or counsellor
<br>
3. teacher, tutor or colleague
<br>
4. religious or spiritual leader
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>There is a list of emotional support lines in the Contact Page</h2>

<h1>Make a Crisis Plan</h1>
<br>
<p>A crisis plan is sometimes called a safety plan. A plan should be made before you are in crisis, but it is never too late to start. You may need someone to help you to make a crisis plan such as a friend or support worker.
<br>The aim of a crisis plan is to think about what support you need when you are in crisis. You could make a list of things that you could do to help yourself.
<br>You can write down the names and numbers of people who would be able to help you. You may find it helpful to include the good things in your life or things that you are looking forward to as part of the plan.
<br>There is no set way for how a crisis plan should look. You can access our crisis plan template by downloading this factsheet using the link at the top of the page.</p>
